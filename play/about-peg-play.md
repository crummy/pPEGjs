#   Play Time

To run any of the files in the play/ directory use:

    > node peg-play.mjs play/some-file.txt

This will compile the pPEG grammar, parse the input tests, and report everything.

Try date.txt for a small example.

This is a simple way to play around with a pPEG grammar.

After developing a grammar the play files can become test case files.

For more info on peg-play.mjs and the test file format:

    > node peg-play.mjs -help
