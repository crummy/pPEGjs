#   Play Time

To run any of the files in this directory use:

    > node peg-play.mjs some-file.txt

This will compile the pPEG grammar, parse the input tests, and report everything.

This is a simple way to play around with a pPEG grammar.

After developing a grammar the play files become test case files.

For more info on peg-play.mjs and the play test file format:

    > node peg-play.mjs --help
